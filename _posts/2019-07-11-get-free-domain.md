## How to get your own URL for free (sort of)!!

In this blog post, we are going to look at how we can get a domain for free (free for 12 months) and get it hosted online also for free.

### Part A:

**Step 1:**

Go to freenom.com and choose your favourite domain.
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image1.png)


Yes you have to choose among .tk .ml .ga .cf and .gq. Sorry no .com .net or .org this time!!
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image3.png)

But if you are ok with it, you can actually own exciting huh exciting huhthe domain for free up to 12 months!! That’s just amazing.



**Step 2:**

Select the domain name you like and go to checkout. Don’t worry. You don’t even have to pull out your credit card.



**Step 3:**

Choose the period you prefer. I personally like the 12 month plan. How about you??

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image2.png)

I have selected a ".tk" domain for this example.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image5.png)

Still with me?? Great!!



**Step 4:**

Now login or create a new account and the domain will be yours!! Exciting huh!!
I personally prefer to sign in with Google. Follow the instructions to finish setting up your account.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image4.png)


**Step 5:**
Review your order

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image7.png)



**Step 6:**
Agree with terms & conditions and click “Complete Order”.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image6.png)

And just like that. You have your very own domain. And you have paid $0.



**Part B:**

If you already have your own hosting, then you can link them together. If you don’t have hosting yet, you may want to follow this guide to set it up with GitHub.


Ok let’s edit the domain records.


**Step 7:**

Click “My Domains” under “Services”.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image9.png)



**Step 8:**

Click “Manage Domain”.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image8.png)



**Step 9:**

Click “Management Freenom DNS”.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image12.png)



**Step 10:**

Add the GitHub A records like so.
- 185.199.108.153
- 185.199.109.153
- 185.199.110.153
- 185.199.111.153

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image10.png)



**Step 11:**

If you also want [www.myfavouritedomain.tk] to map to [myfavouritedomain.tk], then you should also add the CNAME record as below:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image11.png)


**Step 12:**

Wait for the changes to take effect and check your domain.


It works!!

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{image_mgt}}/image13.png)
